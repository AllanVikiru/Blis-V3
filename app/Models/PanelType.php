A diagnostic report or panel is the set of information that is typically provided by a diagnostic service when investigations are complete. The words "tests", "results", "observations", "panels" and "batteries" are often used interchangeably when describing the various parts of a diagnostic report. The information includes a mix of atomic results, text reports, images, and codes. The mix varies depending on the nature of the diagnostic procedure, and sometimes on the nature of the outcomes for a particular investigation. In FHIR, the report can be conveyed in a variety of ways including a Document, RESTful API, or Messaging framework. Included within each of these, would be the DiagnosticReport resource itself.
